# Bookaholics Book Club Application
The Bookaholics book club application was a project I created for my online book club. I wanted each individual book read by the club to have it's own discussion feed, and have the book currently being read displayed on every view.

## Problem to Solve
Currently the Bookaholics book club meets online using Facebook. This hasn't been a very good solution for the group because it is in one general feed. You never really know what is currently being read, when the book is due, or where the discussion feed for that book is. The Bookaholics application allows users to easily access the information they're looking for, and contribute to discussions on an individual book.

## How I Solved It
I created this application using AngularJS, Node, Express and SQL. Every view of the website contains a sidebar which displays which books are currently being read, and when they will be due. The main page displays the cover image of all of the past books that have been read by the club and their title. By clicking on the book, you are taken to a designated book discussion feed.
